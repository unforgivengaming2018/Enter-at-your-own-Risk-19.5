ABOUT
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
 
 This mod adds an additional tab in the skill menu, called "Prestige Skills". It contains 50 new skills to spend your gained perk points on. A localization is provided for the german and japanese language.
 Comes in different versions, for either the normal UI or Sirillion's SMXui being either fully unlocked from the beginning or locked behind a player level of 150. Each file is a fully working standalone, so please
 only use ONE of them at a time.

 This mod is only hosted by me on the nexusmods sites under https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/783?tab=description
 If you've got it somewhere else, it's hosted there without my permission. I'd appreciate it if you'd let me know, if you've got it from somewhere else.

REQUIREMENTS
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
 
 A player must use versions 19.1 through versions 19.3 of 7 Days to Die.
 
 If you want to host a server using this mod, you need at least a serverside install. With only the serverside install the icons for the new menu and skills will be missing for clients, but will still be there
 and fully functional! To work as intended, including the symbols, clients will need to install the mod locally too.

UNINSTALLATION
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

If you're uninstalling the file and want to use your old save, use the forgetting elixir to get back your points!
