This is an Alpha pre-release of Farm Life Revisited (Name subject to change) 
There is much still missing from this. It has been released in order to get feedback and to find any potential problems.

Things of note:

Not all Crops are useful right now
there are still lots of food recipes to come
A Quest System will be coming to help navigate through all the features.
Decor will be a big part of this mod eventually. Plan to add many decorative blocks/items.
Plan to integrate the Vanilla food system/recipes better.
Many more animals will be added.
Vehicles will be added.
Many Items still missing Descriptions...Descriptions will be added and changed to try to be more informative.

What does work?

Everything starts at the Farm Table, craft the Farm table and it will lead you to everything else.
the Focus on this release are all of the availalbe workstations, Crops, Recipes and Animal Cloning(breeding)!
 Webber Grill and Wood Grill are the same item jsut a different model so use whichever you want.
Cold Smoker and Rustic Smoker are the same as well. (Only one recipe so far ..but more will come)

Cloning Chambers!!!

There are two types of Cloning Chambers Normal and Advanced.  Normal ones will break and dissapear after use. you need to craft more to keep trying to clone.
Advanced are permanent and can be reused.

NOTE:  The time to CLone has been set very low right now...this is just so that things can be tested more quickly.  the times will be increased in the future.
